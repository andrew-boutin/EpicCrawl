New Ideas
- Variable level size in designer
- Doors / Portal have visual indicator on designer if they aren't linked to a level yet
- Worlds - allow different sets of levels - create/manage these in the editor?
- User creation of new game objects - create/manage these in the editor?
- Signs hold text - interact with them to pop up sign info

Notes
- Designer mouse drags should be able to prevent multiple events on the same cell by checking the last location first
- Don't allow selecting item headers in combobox http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23722706/how-to-disable-certain-items-in-a-jcombobox

World - starting level & location
Level - knows what is in them, how they connect to other levels
