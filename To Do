Game

Designer
	Mouse dragging spawn multiple click events for same coordinates
		While dragging could save last updated coordinate and ignore if it is reached again
		
	Opening designer is really resource intensive
		Could possibly not save images in object map items
		Have array in designer grid - index corresponds to key of item
			make images as they are needed - if they aren't already made and stored
	
	Wish List
		Undo, Zoom, Log area, delete
	
	Don't put door in house - add in seperately
	Change back to put it in and prompt for portal info
	
	Creating portals correctly when loading level
	
	Don't allow door/portal fill actions...
    Doors have red X over them w/ tool tip if they aren't linked to another door. Portals are OK.
