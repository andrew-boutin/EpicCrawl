Hook up to git hub - make branch for level designer

	Use a better layout on home page

Game

Designer
	Mouse dragging spawn multiple click events for same coordinates
		While dragging could save last updated coordinate and ignore if it is reached again
		
	Opening designer is really resource intensive
		Could possibly not save images in object map items
		Have array in designer grid - index corresponds to key of item
			make images as they are needed - if they aren't already made and stored
	
	Wish List
		Undo, Zoom, Log area, delete
		
	Add extra param to ObjectMapItem - string array of extra info to be saved/parsed
	
	Don't put door in house - add in seperately
	Change back to put it in and prompt for portal info
	
	Creating portals correctly when loading level
